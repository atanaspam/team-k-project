-->There could be some form of communication between the different users. [Extra Feature]
For example:
- A coach can notify the parents or the children about a cancellation or a last-minute change in the schedule.
- A parent (or his/her children, maybe) can contact their coach about an absence.
- A camp manager can inform the parents about an issue related to the camp or the fee payment.
- The super user can notify all the other user groups about updates and maintenances performed on the system.
